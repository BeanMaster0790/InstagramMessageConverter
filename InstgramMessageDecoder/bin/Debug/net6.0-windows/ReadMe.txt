Questions:
1). Why do I see '???' When asked to input a name?
-The user likely has emojis in their name which the terminal cannot show. Emojis show up fine in the txt.
2). Why are photos just a file adress?
-Due to the nature of a text file a picture cannot be shown in the file. the photo can be viewed in the adress given in the txt file.
3). Is their any way to view 'View once' pictures/videos?
-No. These pictures are not included in the download file from Meta.
